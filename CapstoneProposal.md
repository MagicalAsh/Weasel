# Weasel Capstone Proposal
## Why is this worthy as a capstone project?

Weasel would provide a large amount of
industry-like experience, and would solve a
problem I've had many times throughout my summer
at SAS. The current industry ecosystem is very
microservice oriented. Containerization technology
such as Docker and container orchestration technology
such as Kubernetes have recently begun to appear as
well, as containerization shows to be a useful way
of orchestrating a collection of microservices to
do something. Weasel would also be adventure into
extensible code, and developing an API that can be
extended without making direct code changes. 

## What problem does Weasel solve?
One of the problems that I have encountered numerous
times this summer is that of searching a massive
code base. SAS has hundreds of projects, each with
their own dependencies. This means that a feature 
request can involve modifying a handful of projects 
without knowing what may be affected. SAS does have
a tool for searching their code base named Hound,
however it has some strong limitations: it can only
search one git branch, it is slow, and it only
supports basic regular expression searching. Weasel
would solve this by allowing for more targeted
searching, as well as searching in more places such
as non-master git branches.

## What experience would I gain?
The Weasel project would give me experience in
modern technology such as docker and kubernetes,
as well as advanced usage of older technology such
as Git. Weasel would also give me valuable experience
in developing a service from scratch as well as API
development. Lastly, Weasel would give me experience
working on an open-source project.
